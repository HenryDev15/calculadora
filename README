Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in the landside
No escape from reality
Open your eye
look up to the sky and see,
I'm just a poorboy, i need no sympathy
Because i easy cme, easy go,
litle high, litlelow
leave to the wind blows 
nothing really matter to
Me, to me
Mamaaa
Just killed a man
put my gut against his head pulled my trigger,
 now he's dead 
Mamaaaa life had just begun
but now i've got trowing all away
mamaaaaa uuhuhhh
i dont wanna die
and sometime i wish i never was born on
